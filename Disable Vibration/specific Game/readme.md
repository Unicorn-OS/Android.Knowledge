>However, there's actually a way to manually stop vibrations from any Android app on your phone - without completely putting your phone into silent mode. That means you won't have to wait for application developers to update their apps so they can't vibrate your phone.
>Stop Vibrations from Any Android App
The method we are doing is quite simple. All we will be doing is restricting the permission that allows an app to use the device's vibration motor by sending an ADB command. In doing so, the app can't vibrate your phone. Before we begin, we need to install an application so we can figure out what the name of the package is for the app we want to stop vibrations on our phone. Don't worry, it's a totally free (and small) app.
