>Our package is not a standard flashable package that simply unpacks on top of /system. It has very advanced logic that requires the ash shell, as found in TWRP.
>Many other recoveries miss some indispensable commands, and are not compatible with our package.
>What I understood at first sight is that your emulator does not have a real "modern" custom recovery, and simply tries to unpack the ZIP file, therefore it will never be compatible.
>One solution is to ask to the developers if they plan to implement a complete shell with all the commands found in TWRP and the support for "modern" flashable ZIPs (read support for update-binary).
