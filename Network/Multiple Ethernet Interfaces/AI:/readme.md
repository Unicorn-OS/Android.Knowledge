>AI Overview
>
>Android can handle multiple Ethernet connections, though the specific features and methods depend on the device and Android version. For Android 13 and higher, the "STA/STA concurrency" feature allows simultaneous connections to two unrestricted Wi-Fi networks. For Android 11 and later, Ethernet tethering is available, allowing a phone to act as a modem and connect to a router via Ethernet. Additionally, Android uses Linux networking utilities like ifconfig, ip, and ip6tables to configure network interfaces.

>Android 13 and Higher:
>## STA/STA Concurrency:
>This feature enables a device to connect to two Wi-Fi networks concurrently, providing internet access on both.
>
>## Multiple Network Modes:
>The feature can be configured in different modes, such as restricting dual connections to a dual-band AP, connecting to multiple APs, or being disabled.
>
>## API for Apps:
>Apps can check for STA/STA concurrency support and enable or disable the feature if supported. 
>
>## Android 11 and Later:
>**Ethernet Tethering**: Android phones can act as a 4G/5G modem and connect to a router via Ethernet. 
>
># General Android Networking:
>## Linux Utilities:
>Android uses standard Linux networking utilities to configure network interfaces. 
>
>## Ethernet Configuration:
>Internal Ethernet networks can be configured using the `EthernetManager`. 
>
>## Dual Ethernet:
>Some Android devices, particularly those with multiple Ethernet ports, can support dual Ethernet connections, allowing each port to be configured separately. 
>
>## Network Switches:
>Network switches can be used to connect multiple devices to a single Ethernet connection. 
>
>## Ethernet Adapters:
>USB-C to Ethernet adapters or micro USB to Ethernet adapters are often used to connect Android devices to Ethernet.
