>It may already be common knowledge but wanted to let you all know that on most android phones running android 11 you can now do ethernet tethering (via ethernet NOT usb) and use your phone as a 4G/5G modem and connect to any home router via ethernet.

>I was all set and ready to buy either a HUAWEI B818 or HUAWEI 5G CPE Pro 2 but won't need to now.

>I'm currently using my old pixel 2 xl with a Linksys USB 3.0 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter and the ethernet tethering is working perfectly connected to my home router (edge router x). Just to confirm I'm also using a usb c hub with my pixel 2 xl so I can charge the phone and use the ethernet adapter at the same time.
